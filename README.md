# TaxSorted.io

**Tax, understood. Then sorted.**

International tax, made simple for everyone — a person, a business, a charity, a trust:
same door, same plain words, same engine. Three things in one calm place:

- **Learn** — the open book. Every rule we cover explained in plain words: what it means,
  what you must do, what you can skip, how to optimise. Free, public, no account.
- **File** — the workbench. Every figure derived from your records (*derive, never key*),
  the answer first, nothing sent without your eyes and your consent.
- **Connect** — the rails. A direct line to the authorities themselves (HMRC first —
  being built), and the same engine as a typed API: every answer a person reads,
  software will be able to call.

Underneath sits one engine; every country is rules, dates and words plugged into it —
never a fork of the product. The UK is drawn first and drawn deep: the proof, not the limit.

See [PRINCIPLES.md](PRINCIPLES.md) for what we believe.

## Getting Started

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev    # http://localhost:3000
npm test       # the quality gate — tax math is tested as data-driven cases
```

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js 16 (App Router, static export), React 19, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS 4
- **Deployment**: Cloudflare Pages. CI runs test → build on every push (verified green
  2026-06-12); the deploy step switches on once the `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` secret is
  added — until then, deploys are manual via `npm run deploy`
- **Backend**: `api/` — Hono + Postgres on Fly.io (London): anonymous device
  sessions, server-side HMRC OAuth with an encrypted token vault, engine-validated
  submission, immutable receipts. One typed API for humans and agents alike.
  Sandbox first; production filing follows HMRC's approval (see `api/RUNBOOK.md`)
- **Rails**: HMRC MTD (REST) first; each country's authority lights up as it's proven

## Documentation

- [`research/README.md`](research/README.md) — the open book's index
